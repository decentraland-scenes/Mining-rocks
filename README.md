**Scene Usage**


Click on a rock to mine it, a health bar will appear over the rock until it's fully mined. If the rock contained any valuable coins, a floating notification will appear over the rock.

You can open the UI at any moment. This displays the durability of your tool and all of the coins you have collected so far.

If your tool's durability runs out, you won't be able to mine any more.

Open the pop-up UI at any time by clicking the icon on the top-right corner. You can also open it by clicking on the cube that's in the center of the scene.
